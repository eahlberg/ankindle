The Kindle vocabulary is great for looking up words while reading, but it is
not very fun to go back and study. This simple tool fetches words from the
vocabulary, translates them using the Yandex translate API and dumps them into
a csv database for usage with e.g. spaced repetition tools like
[Anki](http://ankisrs.net).
