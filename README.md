The Kindle vocabulary is great for looking up words while reading, but it is
not very fun for studying. This simple tool fetches words from the vocabulary,
translates them using the Yandex translate API and dumps them into a csv
database for usage with e.g. spaced repetition tools like
[Anki](http://ankisrs.net).

## Requirements
- Yandex Translate API key
- Only tested on OS X (path may differ)
